# Client Solution Brief

## Client Situation

The fictional client is a midsize regional organization with approximately 750 employees across multiple facilities.

Service work currently enters through a mix of email, phone, chat, spreadsheets, direct technician contact, and an inconsistently used ticketing platform.

The result is a service environment with:

* unclear ownership
* inconsistent prioritization
* duplicate or lost work
* weak SLA visibility
* informal approvals
* limited asset and configuration context
* weak vendor accountability
* inconsistent closure
* limited knowledge reuse
* unreliable reporting

The issue is not a lack of technical capability.

It is the absence of a consistent service-management operating model.

---

## Recommended Solution

Implement a vendor-neutral Enterprise Service Management model centered on one authoritative service record and four core processes:

* Incident Management
* Service Request Management
* Change Management
* Knowledge Management

The target design should also establish:

* controlled intake
* defined service ownership
* impact / urgency-based priority
* SLA and escalation rules
* auditable approvals
* RBAC and separation of duties
* service / asset / CI relationships
* vendor-access governance
* controlled automation
* measurable service performance

The guiding principle is:

> **Standardize the process before relying on the platform to automate it.**

---

## Phase 1 Scope

Initial implementation should focus on the capabilities required to create a stable operating foundation.

### Included

* users, roles, and support groups
* core services
* Incident Management
* Service Request Management
* Change Management
* Knowledge Management
* service catalog
* priority and SLA logic
* ownership and escalation
* approval workflows
* basic service / asset / CI relationships
* RBAC
* reporting
* testing and UAT
* training and go-live support

### Deferred Until Stabilization

* broad workflow orchestration
* extensive integrations
* oversized CMDB development
* advanced predictive analytics
* high-autonomy AI functionality

The objective is to establish a trusted core service model before adding complexity.

## Implementation Approach

The recommended implementation sequence is:

```text
Discovery
   ↓
Requirements Validation
   ↓
Core Configuration
   ↓
Data Preparation
   ↓
Pilot
   ↓
UAT
   ↓
Training
   ↓
Go-Live
   ↓
Hypercare
   ↓
Optimization
```

Each phase should have defined exit criteria before the next begins.

## Key Design Decisions

### One Managed Record

Service activity should enter and remain connected to the managed platform.

### Ownership Stays Visible

Reassignment, escalation, waiting states, and vendor involvement should not remove internal accountability.

### Control Scales With Risk

Routine activity should remain efficient while privileged access, high-risk change, and material exceptions receive stronger approval and evidence requirements.

### Automation Follows Process

Stable, repeatable decisions should be automated only after ownership, rules, and data are reliable.

### AI Assists Rather Than Authorizes

AI may support summarization, categorization, knowledge retrieval, and drafting, but controlled decisions remain subject to human authority.

---

## Expected Business Value

The target state is intended to produce:

* clearer ownership
* more consistent prioritization
* fewer duplicate or lost requests
* measurable SLA performance
* stronger approval history
* better vendor accountability
* improved knowledge reuse
* more reliable management reporting
* better visibility into recurring issues
* a foundation for future automation and optimization

These are target outcomes to be validated through testing, UAT, and production metrics.

---

## Key Assumptions

This recommendation assumes:

* executive sponsorship exists
* process owners are available
* service ownership can be defined
* the organization is willing to reduce informal intake
* users and support teams will participate in UAT and training
* the selected ESM platform supports configurable workflows, approvals, RBAC, and reporting

---

## Primary Risks

The main implementation risks are:

* reproducing current-state problems inside the new platform
* weak ownership decisions
* excessive customization
* poor source data
* low user adoption
* unresolved legacy intake
* automating unstable processes too early

These risks should be addressed during discovery, design, pilot, and go-live readiness review.

---

## Recommendation

Proceed with a phased ESM implementation focused first on process consistency, ownership, control, and usable service data.

Do not begin with advanced automation or platform customization.

Build the operating model first.

Then use the platform to reinforce it.

**Recommended next step:** confirm stakeholder requirements and Phase 1 scope before configuration begins.
